// Creating a model using mongoose ? //
// A Model is like a blue print to create documents , So it is like creating classes in JavaScript which are like blueprints
// which we use to create objects out of them , To do CRUD operations we basically need a mongoose model. And inorder to create a model
// we need a schema . We use schema to describe our data , setting default  values , to validate the data . Below we will create a
// Tour schema to describe our tours

// const tourSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
//   name: {
//     type: String,
//     required: [true, "A tour must have a name"],
//     unique: true,
//   },
//   rating: {
//     type: Number,
//     default: 4.5,
//   },
//   price: {
//     type: Number,
//     required: [true, "A tour must have a price"],
//   },
// });

// const Tour = mongoose.model("Tour", tourSchema); // Try to use Upper cases in model names and variables which is a convention to follow

// const testTour = new Tour({
//   name: "The Park Camper",
//   rating: 4.7,
//   price: 497,
// }); // This testTour document that we have just created is an instance of the tour model . So on the testTour instance we can use
// // a couple of methods to interact with the database

// testTour
//   .save()
//   .then((doc) => {
//     console.log(doc);
//   })
//   .catch((err) => {
//     console.log("Error :", err);
//   }); // This will save it in the tours collection of the database and this save() method will return a promise where we
// // can consume it . The result value of the promise that the save() method returns is the final document as it is in the database.

// console.log(app.get("env")); // It will print "development" in the console refering that we are currently in the development environment.
// // This app.get("env") will get us the environment variable .Environment variables are global variables that are used to define the
// // environment in which a node.app is running . This one is set by express but node.js itself sets a lot of environments and please
// // remember that this .env variable was actuall set by express but node.js itself sets a lot of environment variables.

// console.log(process.env);

/// HOW TO HANDLE UNHANDLED REJECTIONS ///////////////
/* Each time when there is an unhandled rejection then somewhere in our application a process object will emit an object
called  unhandled rejection and so we can subscribe to that event just like this below*/

process.on("unhandledRejection", (err) => {
  // Here in the below line we want to log the error to the console so that it shows up in the logs in our server , then
  // it gives us a way to fix the problem and then we want to gracefully shutdown the server
  console.log("UNHANDLED REJECTION ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ Shutting down...");
  console.log(err.name, err.message);
  server.close(() => {}); // After the server is closed then this call-back function will run
  process.exit(1); // Here zero(0) stands for success and one(1) stands for uncaught exception . Here this process.exit() will
  // abort all the requests that are currently still running (or) pending
});

// In the above unhandled rejection crashing the application is optional as we did above but when there is an uncaught
// exception then we really need to crash our application because after there was an uncaught exception then the entire
// node process is in a so called unclean state . So to fix this the process needs to terminate and then it needs to be
// restarted. But again in a production we should have a tool in place which will restart the application after crashing
// and many hosting services do that out of the box automatically.

/* In node.js it is not really a good practice  to just blindly rely on the above two Error handlers which are
  UNHANDLED REJECTION and UNCAUGHT EXCEPTION . So ideally errors should be handled right where they occur
  So for example , in the problem connecting to the database where we should add a catch handler and not just simply rely
   on the unhandled rejection call-back that we have above and some people even say we shouldn't even use them at
   all  */
